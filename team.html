<p>
I am a Mechanical Engineering and Cognitive Brain Science major at Tufts. As part of my degree I am working in a Cognitive Science Lab, which helped me formulate the idea for -sPARK+. Having previously worked as a Teaching Assistant and Camp Counselor, I enjoy the process of education and hope to bring that energy with me. Outside of academics I am passionate about travel, hiking, and swimming.
